/**
 * Spring WebSocket / STOMP configuration for the collaboratif module.
 *
 * <p><strong>Renamed from {@code WebSocketConfig} (EN53.2 Vague 2 modulith merge).</strong> The
 * agilite module (EN53.1 Vague 1) already registers its own {@code
 * fr.pivot.agilite.config.WebSocketConfig} {@code @Configuration} bean; both would otherwise
 * generate the identical default Spring bean id {@code webSocketConfig} once component-scanned
 * into the same aggregated {@code pivot-core-app} context, which fails context startup with a
 * {@code ConflictingBeanDefinitionException}. Renaming this module's copy (rather than agilite's,
 * which merged first) resolves the collision without touching already-shipped code.
 *
 * <p>Registers the STOMP endpoint at {@code CollaboratifApiPaths.BASE + "/ws/whiteboard"}, i.e.
 * {@code /collaboratif/ws/whiteboard} (relative to the aggregated app's single global {@code
 * server.servlet.context-path: /api}). The full WebSocket URL in production is:
 * {@code ws://{host}/api/collaboratif/ws/whiteboard} — the exact same external contract this
 * module's standalone deployment produced via its former dedicated {@code
 * server.servlet.context-path: /api/collaboratif}, restored here without depending on any
 * per-module deployment-time configuration (mirrors {@code AgiliteApiPaths}'s equivalent fix for
 * the agilite module's own {@code /ws/agilite} endpoint, EN53.1 Vague 1). See {@link
 * CollaboratifApiPaths}'s class JavaDoc for the full routing rationale.
 *
 * <p>Broker configuration uses an in-process {@link org.springframework.messaging.simp.broker.SimpleBroker}
 * for the whiteboard's own {@code /topic/whiteboard/*} and {@code /queue} traffic (per-board
 * room pub/sub, presence, error notifications) — unchanged by EN07.3, since a browser-facing
 * room-broadcast round trip does not need cross-instance durability guarantees, and this
 * traffic's tested behavior (heartbeat, room isolation, rate limiting — EN08.1/US08.3.1)
 * must not regress. (The prefix was narrowed here from the previous bare {@code "/topic"} to
 * {@code "/topic/whiteboard"} — verified against every {@code /topic/...} destination in this
 * codebase, all of which are already {@code /topic/whiteboard/...}; this only makes the
 * existing scope explicit ahead of the new registration below, no destination changes.)
 *
 * <p><strong>EN07.3</strong> adds a second, independent broker registration — a STOMP relay to
 * the shared ActiveMQ broker (KahaDB persistence, built in {@code pivot-core}) — scoped
 * strictly to the {@code /topic/collaboratif.} prefix (note the trailing dot: destinations use
 * dot-hierarchy, not slashes, because ActiveMQ's wildcard destination matching — used by the
 * broker's per-domain Dead Letter Queue policy, {@code DLQ.collaboratif} — only matches
 * dot-separated segments). This is the cross-module-core domain event bus (future quiz/session/
 * forms features under E30 that need to notify other domains); nothing publishes on it yet.
 * Spring supports both a {@code SimpleBroker} and a {@code StompBrokerRelay} registered
 * simultaneously in the same {@code configureMessageBroker}, each handling its own disjoint
 * destination prefixes as separate message handlers (confirmed against
 * {@code MessageBrokerRegistry.getSimpleBroker()}/{@code getStompBrokerRelay()} — each returns
 * a handler only if its own registration method was called). In production this is fully
 * additive and safe.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@code pivot.activemq.relay-enabled} toggle:</strong> registering the relay is
 * gated behind this flag (default {@code true}). This is not optional polish — empirically,
 * registering a {@code StompBrokerRelay} whose target is unreachable (as happens in every
 * pre-existing whiteboard IT test, which know nothing about EN07.3 and provide no broker)
 * does not fail in isolation: the relay's repeated connection failures were observed to
 * cascade into {@code ConnectionLostException}/"Connection closed" errors on the *whiteboard's
 * own* {@code SimpleBroker} WebSocket sessions in {@code WhiteboardWebSocketIT},
 * {@code WhiteboardCanvasIT} and {@code WhiteboardPresenceIT} — i.e. the two registrations are
 * not as isolated at runtime as the registry API suggests once one of them is actually failing
 * to connect. {@code application-test.yml} sets this flag to {@code false}, so none of the
 * pre-existing tests register the relay at all (byte-for-byte the pre-EN07.3 behavior); the
 * dedicated {@code CollaboratifWebSocketConfigRelayIT} for this Enabler overrides it back to
 * {@code true} against a real Testcontainers broker.
 *
 * <p><strong>Known limitation, not further chased here:</strong> this means the relay is
 * never actually exercised end-to-end against a *live* broker alongside the whiteboard's own
 * WebSocket traffic in this test suite (only in isolation, in {@code CollaboratifWebSocketConfigRelayIT}) —
 * acceptable for this Enabler's scope (wiring the relay, not yet publishing anything on it),
 * flagged here for whoever implements the first feature that actually uses
 * {@code /topic/collaboratif.*}.
 *
 * <p><strong>Known gap</strong> (documented, accepted, consistent with this codebase's existing
 * practice of flagging rather than silently ignoring known limitations — see e.g. pivot-core's
 * unauthenticated-Redis gap note): the existing whiteboard destinations
 * ({@code /topic/whiteboard/{boardId}}, slash-separated) are NOT relayed and therefore never
 * get the broker's named {@code DLQ.collaboratif} routing even if a future US relays them —
 * ActiveMQ's dot-hierarchy wildcard (its {@code destinationPolicy} in {@code activemq.xml})
 * cannot match a slash-delimited destination, which becomes one opaque segment to it (verified
 * empirically). Renaming the whiteboard destinations to dot-hierarchy would fix this but is a
 * breaking change requiring coordination with {@code pivot-collaboratif-ui} — out of scope here.
 *
 * <p>Identity is established in two stages (EN08.3, ADR-022), deliberately <strong>after</strong>
 * the WebSocket upgrade rather than as part of the HTTP handshake — a custom {@code Authorization}
 * header cannot be set on a WebSocket handshake from browser JavaScript, and a token in the
 * handshake URL is unacceptable exposure (access/proxy logs, browser history):
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link StompHandshakeHandler} assigns no identity at all during the HTTP upgrade — the
 *       session starts anonymous.</li>
 *   <li>{@link StompAuthenticationChannelInterceptor}, registered first on the client inbound
 *       channel (see {@link #configureClientInboundChannel}), authenticates the bearer token
 *       carried as a native header on the first STOMP frame ({@code CONNECT}) and establishes
 *       the real {@link fr.pivot.collaboratif.whiteboard.ws.StompPrincipal} for the rest of the
 *       session — see that class's JavaDoc for the full rationale and the design history it
 *       replaced.</li>
 * </ol>
 * {@link WhiteboardChannelInterceptor}, registered second, then enforces board membership on
 * every SUBSCRIBE and SEND frame using that established principal.
 *
 * <p>Payload size is capped at 64 KB per frame as required by EN08.1 — enforced at
 * <strong>two</strong> levels, both required for the US08.3.1 AC ("payload &gt; limite → STOMP
 * ERROR frame sans déconnecter les autres participants") to actually hold:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link WebSocketTransportRegistration#setMessageSizeLimit} — Spring's own STOMP frame
 *       decoder limit. When exceeded, {@code SubProtocolWebSocketHandler} catches the resulting
 *       {@code StompConversionException} and sends a graceful STOMP ERROR frame back to the
 *       sender without touching the connection or any other session — this is the behavior the
 *       AC actually wants.</li>
 *   <li>{@link ServletServerContainerFactoryBean} ({@link #webSocketContainer}) — the underlying
 *       Jakarta WebSocket container's own {@code maxTextMessageBufferSize}. This defaults to
 *       Tomcat's built-in 8 KB, which is <em>smaller</em> than the 64 KB STOMP-level limit above.
 *       Verified empirically (integration test sending a 70 KB DRAW payload): without raising
 *       this container-level buffer, the raw WebSocket frame never reaches Spring's STOMP
 *       decoder at all — Tomcat itself hard-closes the connection with code 1009 ("message too
 *       big") before Spring gets a chance to send the graceful ERROR frame, which is exactly the
 *       disconnect the AC says must NOT happen. Both limits must therefore be configured
 *       together, with the container limit set comfortably above the STOMP-level one, so the
 *       STOMP decoder is always the one that fires first for a payload in the documented range.</li>
 * </ol>
