/**
 * Response payload representing a whiteboard board visible to the caller.
 *
 * <p>The {@code role} field reflects the caller's role on this board (e.g. {@code "OWNER"},
 * {@code "EDITOR"}, {@code "VIEWER"} — {@link BoardRole#name()}, matching {@code MemberResponse}
 * and the WS JOIN broadcast's casing, see {@code CanvasActionService#resolveRoleName}). After
 * creation, it is always {@code "OWNER"}.
 *
 * <p>Fields {@code thumbnailUrl} and {@code activeParticipantCount} are stubs for
 * future integrations (thumbnail storage and WebSocket presence registry respectively).
 *
 * <p>{@code favorite} reflects whether the calling user has favorited this board
 * (US08.1.6, strictly personal — never derived from another user's favorite). {@code
 * description}, {@code coverImage}, {@code maxParticipants}, and {@code enabledActivities}
 * are the board settings introduced by US08.2.4. {@code deletedAt} is only meaningfully
 * populated when the board is returned as part of the trash listing (US08.1.7) — it is
 * {@code null} in every other response (normal list/get), even though the field is always
 * present in the JSON shape for a stable contract.
 *
 * @param id                     unique identifier of the board
 * @param title                  human-readable board title
 * @param role                   the caller's role on this board ({@link BoardRole#name()})
 * @param createdAt              timestamp when the board was created
 * @param updatedAt              timestamp of the last board update
 * @param tenantId               {@code public.tenants.id} of the tenant that owns this board
 * @param thumbnailUrl           URL of the board thumbnail image, or {@code null} in Socle
 * @param activeParticipantCount number of users currently active on the board
 * @param favorite               {@code true} if the calling user has favorited this board
 * @param description            optional board description, or {@code null}
 * @param coverImage             optional cover image URL, or {@code null}
 * @param maxParticipants        optional maximum simultaneous participant count, or
 *                               {@code null} for unlimited
 * @param enabledActivities      whitelisted activity codes enabled on this board
 * @param deletedAt              trash timestamp, populated only in trash listings, otherwise
 *                               {@code null}
 * @param shareCount             number of active shares (members other than the owner) on this
 *                               board (US08.1.9, parity §2.2)
 * @param cards                  the board's cards with their field values, populated only by
 *                               {@code GET /whiteboard/boards/{boardId}} (US08.1.9) — empty in
 *                               every other response (list/create/patch/trash), which
 *                               deliberately do not fetch cards to avoid overloading those
 *                               queries
