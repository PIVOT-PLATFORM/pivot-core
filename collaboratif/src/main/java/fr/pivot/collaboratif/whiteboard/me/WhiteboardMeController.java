/**
 * Exposes the authenticated caller's own {@code public.users.id} to the frontend
 * (US08.12.2 enabler).
 *
 * <p>The dot-vote UI needs to know which votes in a {@code VoteSession} belong to the current
 * user (remaining vote budget, own dots, un-casting). That identity is never carried on the
 * realtime channel — it is resolved server-side from the authenticated principal and the
 * room-wide {@code board:state} snapshot is broadcast to every participant, so it cannot deliver
 * a per-client self identity. This tiny REST endpoint fills the gap, server-authoritatively and
 * durably across reconnects.
 *
 * <p>The identity comes exclusively from the {@link CollaboratifRequestPrincipal} resolved from the bearer
 * token (EN08.3) — never from the request. No board scope is involved: the caller's user id is
 * the same regardless of the board being viewed.
