/**
 * REST controller exposing read-only access to a board's dot-voting sessions
 * (Vote / dot-voting feature). Complements the STOMP mutation channel ({@code vote:*}, see
 * {@link VoteActionService}) so a client that connects mid-vote — or reopens the board — can
 * rehydrate the live vote and the last result without waiting for the next broadcast (frontend
 * {@code board.store.ts#loadVote}).
 *
 * <p>All endpoints require a valid {@code Authorization: Bearer <token>} header, resolved into a
 * {@link CollaboratifRequestPrincipal} by {@code CollaboratifRequestPrincipalResolver} (EN08.3). Tenant and user identity
 * always come from the resolved principal — never from the request. A board that is unknown,
 * cross-tenant, or that the caller is not a member of resolves to HTTP 404 (never 403), so the
 * endpoint never confirms a resource the caller may not see.
 *
 * <p>The full path (including the application context) is
 * {@code /api/collaboratif/whiteboard/boards/{boardId}/vote/...}.
