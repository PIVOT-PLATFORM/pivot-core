 * <p>Every mutating query below scopes explicitly by both {@code id} <strong>and</strong>
 * {@code boardId} — never {@code id} alone — so that a card id belonging to a different board
 * (guessed or leaked cross-tenant) can never be mutated through a forged request. Move/resize/
 * update/recolor additionally guard on {@code locked = false} directly in the query itself
 * (rather than a separate read-then-write check), returning the number of affected rows so the
 * caller can silently skip the broadcast when the card was locked, already deleted, or on a
 * different board (all three cases collapse to {@code 0} rows affected, indistinguishable to the
 * caller by design — see {@link CanvasActionService}).
